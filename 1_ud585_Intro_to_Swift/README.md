# ud585: UIKit Fundamentals
This repo contains the app I built for the Udacity iOS Nanodegree Program course **Intro to iOS App Development with Swift**. The App is completely written from scratch in Swift.

This course introduces Swift by building an iPhone app, PitchPerfect, that records a conversation between you and a friend, and then makes your voices sound like a Chipmunk or Darth Vader by altering the pitch of the audio we record.

We are introduced to the following iOS classes in this course:

- UIButton
- UILabel
- NSLayoutConstraint
- UIView
- UIViewController
- UINavigationController
- AVAudioPlayer
- AVFoundation
- AVAudioRecorder
- AVAudioEngine
- AVAudioPlayerNode
- AVAudioUnitTimePitch
