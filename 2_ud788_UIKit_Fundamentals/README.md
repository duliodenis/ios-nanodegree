# ud788: UIKit Fundamentals
This repo contains the app I built for the Udacity iOS Nanodegree Program course UIKit Fundamentals. The App is completely written from scratch in Swift.

In this course, we built a series of simple apps to become more comfortable with the UIKit framework and master its most widely used components. This framework constitutes the building blocks of the user interface for all iOS apps, and is crucial for any iOS Developer to be intimately familiar with.

This course culminates with the creation of a meme generating app, MemeMe. This App covers collection views, tab bar controllers, how to adjust the screen to accommodate the keyboard, and how to access the camera.

The following UIKit classes are introduced:

- UICollectionView
- UICollectionViewDelegate
- UICollectionViewDatasource
- UITabBarController

The following special guest classes from the Foundation framework make an appearence:

- NSNotification
- NSNotificationCenter
