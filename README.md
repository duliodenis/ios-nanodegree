# The Udacity iOS Nanodegree
This repo contains the apps I built in the [Udacity iOS Nanodegree Program](https://www.udacity.com/course/ios-developer-nanodegree--nd003). All Apps are completely written from scratch in Swift.

Over the course of the iOS Developer Nanodegree program you undertake five courses that each culminate in a portfolio-worthy iOS app that is designed to demonstrate expertise as an iOS Developer in those areas the course covers. These apps are written in Swift, Appleâ€™s custom programming language designed specifically for building iOS and OS X apps. 

The five courses in the nanodegree and final project in each course are as follow:
