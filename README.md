# The Udacity iOS Nanodegree
This repo contains the apps I built in the Udacity iOS Nanodegree Program. All Apps are completely written from scratch in Swift.

Over the course of the iOS Developer Nanodegree program five portfolio-worthy iOS apps that demonstrate expertise as an iOS Developer are built. These apps are written in Swift, Appleâ€™s custom programming language designed specifically for building iOS and OS X apps.
